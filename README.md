# RGB-Mamba: Boundary Guided Region Dual Scan Mode Make Mamba Stronger in 2D & 3D Medical Image Segmentation

Mamba is a state-space model (SSM) that has demonstrated excellent performance in natural language processing and sequence modeling in recent years, and has gradually expanded into computer vision, particularly in the field of medical image segmentation. However, existing VM models often employ whole-image or block-wise linear scanning, which fails to adequately capture spatial details of different target regions, particularly in scenarios with blurred boundaries or small targets, limiting their application in diverse and challenging 2D and 3D medical imaging tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient medical image segmentation model, RGB-Mamba, which significantly improves segmentation performance through three key mechanisms: 
i. Boundary Attention (BA) guides the model to locate the segmentation boundaries and perform global scanning within them, obtaining global coarse boundary information; 
ii. Region Attention (RA) refines the coarse global boundary information, enhancing recognition of small-scale and ambiguous structures, improving the model's ability to recognize small-volume targets, complex structures, and blurred areas; 
iii. Interactive Dual Scan (IDS) integrates boundary and region attention responses, dynamically modeling multi-scale interactions between global coarse and local fine boundary information, thereby improving the model's ability to express complex spatial structures. 
Experimental results on multiple 2D and 3D medical image segmentation datasets show that RGB-Mamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in most tasks. For the benefit of the community, we make the source code public.

The code is comming soon ...
